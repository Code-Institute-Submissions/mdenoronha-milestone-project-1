Video modal code was Bootstrap modal and additional help provided by https://codepen.io/anon/pen/LgJRjz. Primarily for jQuery to stop video playing after modal closed. jQuery has been updated
as it was targeting a button with class .video-btn but now targets < a> element with class .video-link (as no buttons are used). Modal has also been styled.
